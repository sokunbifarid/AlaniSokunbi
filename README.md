- 👋 Hi, I’m Sokunbi Farid, a freelancing game developer. I'm a proficient game developer using the godot game engine with interest in various gaming categories, I'm currently looking into incorporating cloud technologies into online game features. 
- 👀 I'm always intrested in developing role playing games which involves character controls and character interactions. I could develop in the 2D or 3D workspace depending on which my heart draws to.
      I also enjoy creating AI codes and automated programming which I feel gives a unique feel to games and how the player interacts with it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D modelling and animation. I plan to start working full time on 3D games and build my portfolio on that. By learning 3D game development I want to hop on the virtual world and create a better virtual experience to the gaming community.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other indie developers and artist to work on projects which could shine more light on the indie community.
      I'm also looking to collaborate with big game developing companies and agencies to learn and develop with other team members and have a clear understanding of team work.
